Requirements
============

### Core

 - User should be able to mark topics as `learned` (possibly on different levels such as basic or advanced) or `want to learn`.
 - The graph will highlight what the learner needs to learn in order to learn what they want to in the end.
   - Example: If I want to learn how to build rockets, I should mark the topic/goal "build a rocket" as `want to learn` and subsequently, the graph/tree will highlight what I need to know to get there (ballistic physics, orbital mechanics).
 - The graph should provide learning resources for the topics I want/need to learn.

### Extras

 - Voting/rating of learning resources
   - Reddit-style voting or rating?
   - Votes/ratings will likely differ largely depending on the learners pre-existing knowledge.
 - Wiki-like editing of the tree (each node a file?)
   - Crowdsourcing of learning resources would be necessary for a global-scale thing (like Wikipedia), but obviously a long way there. One step at a time.
 - Gamification
   - This would likely increase user activity by a lot. Thanks @nikitavoloboev for the idea!
 - Crowdsourcing
   - (see the browser extension extra)
 - Browser extension
   - To record viewed resources.
   - To help crowdsource the datbase
     - If something is a learning resource, the extension should detect it is in the database (and the user provided a link to the entry in the tree) and if it isn't the user should be able to submit it. 
 - ActivityWatch import
   - Could be immensly helpful in building the database and could provide a way to collect data without a specific browser plugin for starters (and share code later on).
