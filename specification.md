Specification
=============


## The graph

Should contain nodes for subjects/topics/concepts and learning resources to learn them. Each user should additionally be able to mark a node as "learned" (see [#User_Progress]()).


## Learning prerequisites 

A topic/concept can have one or more learning prerequisite, a kind of "learning dependency". Perhaps with varying degrees of strength.


## User Progress

The user should be able to monitor their progress by setting their level of understanding/aquaintance for a concept/topic.

Could function as a kind of gamification mechanism.


# Views

## Concept

The view for a concept should:

 - Summary from Wikipedia (+ link to the full article) if an article on the concept exists (same as topic).
 - Link to learning resources

## Field / Branch / Topic

Should contain a link to the Wikipedia article about itself and perhaps the summary from the article.
